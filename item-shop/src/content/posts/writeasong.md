If you are anything like me, then a blank canvas is one of the most stress inducing things ever. Don't get me wrong, I love starting something. But those first few moments where the possibilities are endless can be terrifying. Like driving over a steep bridge where you cant see the other side until you get to the top.

WriteASong.Today is here to alleviate some of that for the modern musician. This is a simple app I threw together that gives the user a songwriting guide to get the creative juices flowing. Simply click on 'Get Inspired' to receive a random key and tempo, as well as a few standard chord progressions in the key. You can also randomize each element individually if you want.

So go ahead and get inspired. I would love to hear what you come up with!
