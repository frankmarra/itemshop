description: A social network app for musicians to connect and collaborate
---

Colab is a social network site where musicians can sign-up and post tracks that they have been working on, but have yet to finish. Other users can scan the site based on genre, tempo, instruments, and name.

If you find a track that you like, you can contact the creator and see if they would like to collaborate with you.

This site was made to help facilitate the creation of new music with new people that can help take your tracks in directions you wouldn't have otherwise explored.
