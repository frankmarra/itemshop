Over the past couple of days, I have been trying to spend about an hour creating music. It helps clear my head and get me in a creative zone. But doing this has made me realize that sometimes I get stuck on the details.

I made WriteASong.Today as a kick start to the songwriting process. It will provide you with a key, common progressions in that key, and a tempo to start writing with. Maybe you just use the tempo, or maybe you take one of the progressions and switch up the key.

So go ahead and get inspired. I would love to hear what you come up with!
